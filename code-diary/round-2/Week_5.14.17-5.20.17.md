# Week of 5.14.17 - 5.20.17

## May 16, 2017 - Tuesday

### TIL

I'm trying to finish reading YDKJS in addition to the tutorial. The bulk of what I ready today involved Classes and Object in JavaScript. How there are no real classes in JavaScript. That it is all Objects. One interesting thing that occurred was realizing that 'copying' a class often means copying a reference. That changing even a child object can impact its parent and vice versa obviously. I don't know currently if there is a way around it, or necessarily how it is handled.

### What did I like?

I liked understanding Classes and Objects a little deeper from the YDKJS. Although, I'm quite certain this is stuff I've learned before. Refreshers are always good though.

I completed the modules in the node course on Geolocation and File handling and image resizing. I liked all of it to be honest, but it does come with the caveat that is in the next section.

### What didn't I like?

I don't think I will continue the course at this moment. I love Wes's courses. I really do. I find them to be some of the most informative courses. I __constantly__ referred to them while building react apps. However, I feel the node course falls victim to the same thing that the React course did. It's just not the most beginner friendly. If I'm new to node, this probably isn't the course for me. He loves to keep people super up to date on the newest technology and trends being used. Usually, it's too much at once. Yes, you learn all kinds of awesome up-to-date practices, but shit, he sure unleashes the fire hose. 

I think I'll be better off for now, deferring to alternate material and revisiting. Just like I did with React for Beginners. 

### Separate Note

I think I'm going to give Front End Masters a shot. I'll take my own advice and really focus on front end still. They have some great courses. I'm really interested in their Chrome Dev Tools course actually. It's not something you see a lot, but debugging is obviously crucial.

Day off. With my move coming up and my job starting soon. I will likely have more days off from the challenge than I initially anticipated.

### TIL

Moving along in Wes's course. I completed module 4 today. So I learned about flash messages, how to query the database for the information we have, and how to edit that information after it's been created.

### What did I like?

Honestly, I really liked everything. Pug is starting to grow on me more. I'm easily starting to see some of its efficiencies.

### What didn't I like?

I still struggle with Wes's pace as well as the fact that the entire front end is made for us. I guess I should stop mentioning that one, but it does bother me a bit... a lot. ðŸ˜€
