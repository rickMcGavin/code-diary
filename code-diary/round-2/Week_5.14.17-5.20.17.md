# Week of 5.14.17 - 5.20.17

### TIL

the 'let' keyword does not hoist. 

Hoisting. Declarations are handled during the compile phase, and it is thought of that they are _hoisted_ 

### What did I like?

I continue to enjoy the video presentation of the advanced JS concepts. Things I thought I had a grasp on become even clearer now like hosting and the subtleties of the let keyword.

### What didn't I like?

Mostly the first exercise. It wasn't as good a I was hoping, but served its purpose in firming the knowledge thus far.

## May 19, 2017 - Friday

Still working my way through the Front End Masters course by Kyle Simpson called Advanced JavaScript. It really does seem to be the video course version of YDKJS, and it's fantastic. You can get through it quicker than reading the book series, and it is **much** easier to understand.

### TIL

Function Declaration and function expression

A declaration has the 'function' keyword as the first word in the statement.

Function expressions are often used as anonymous functions. _I think I remember the AirBnB style guide stating you should only write function expressions_. When you name them it is interesting how you'll get a keyword to call the function for the outer scope, and a separate keyword for the inner scope. I can see how that would be beneficial. 

eval() and with should largely be avoided. In strict mode the with keyword is **disabled**.

let keyword vs. var keyword. They var keyword could be best to use when you want to bind to the function. The let keyword could be best when you want to bind to the block.

### What did I like?

I like better understanding when it may be appropriate to use var and when it may be most appropriate to use let. At this time, I basically only use let though. I will have to see if the situation presents itself where I'd want to bind to the function and not the block.

I love the way Kyle slowly walks you through his code examples. I can tell now how the books were supposed to be presented, but being forced to slow down and think about how a piece of code is compiled and executed is a practice much better done live.

### What didn't I like?

Still nothing. Love this front end masters course.

### TIL

__Compiling function scope__

Scope Resolution & Compilation phase
Execution phase

Left hand side (LHS) is the target 
Right Hand Side (RHS) is the source

### What did I like?

I liked stepping through the code and determining how JavaScript would compile it. It was far more beneficial to do this in a video than the way it is done in YDKJS.

### What didn't I like?

I got a little distracted looking at this CLT Junior Devs page. I should really contribute to this bad boy.

### TIL

I picked up the Front End Master's subscription. So far, absolutely no regrets. I've been taking the Advanced JavaScript course by Kyle Simpson. First, this is a little more robust than the free version they offer I've realized. 

I learned and refreshed on somethings I knew, especially regarding scope. I have a strong grasp on scope. Some of the extras I picked up were found in his resources. He advised using the ECMA spec more. I never would have thought of this. He walked through some examples, and it does spell a lot out. You can tell that he basically distilled a lot of his knowledge from the ECMA spec. 

### What did I like?

I like how the course is in a heavy lecture format right now. I could use a course that isn't necessarily a code along. I am definitely interested in learning this more deeply, and it's nowhere near as dry as the YDKJS books. Kyle is a great instructor in person. That did not seem to translate to his book series, which is fine.

### What didn't I like?

Nothing! hah first time ever.

## May 16, 2017 - Tuesday

### TIL

I'm trying to finish reading YDKJS in addition to the tutorial. The bulk of what I ready today involved Classes and Object in JavaScript. How there are no real classes in JavaScript. That it is all Objects. One interesting thing that occurred was realizing that 'copying' a class often means copying a reference. That changing even a child object can impact its parent and vice versa obviously. I don't know currently if there is a way around it, or necessarily how it is handled.

### What did I like?

I liked understanding Classes and Objects a little deeper from the YDKJS. Although, I'm quite certain this is stuff I've learned before. Refreshers are always good though.

I completed the modules in the node course on Geolocation and File handling and image resizing. I liked all of it to be honest, but it does come with the caveat that is in the next section.

### What didn't I like?

I don't think I will continue the course at this moment. I love Wes's courses. I really do. I find them to be some of the most informative courses. I __constantly__ referred to them while building react apps. However, I feel the node course falls victim to the same thing that the React course did. It's just not the most beginner friendly. If I'm new to node, this probably isn't the course for me. He loves to keep people super up to date on the newest technology and trends being used. Usually, it's too much at once. Yes, you learn all kinds of awesome up-to-date practices, but shit, he sure unleashes the fire hose. 

I think I'll be better off for now, deferring to alternate material and revisiting. Just like I did with React for Beginners. 

### Separate Note

I think I'm going to give Front End Masters a shot. I'll take my own advice and really focus on front end still. They have some great courses. I'm really interested in their Chrome Dev Tools course actually. It's not something you see a lot, but debugging is obviously crucial.

## May 15, 2017 - Monday

Day off. With my move coming up and my job starting soon. I will likely have more days off from the challenge than I initially anticipated.

## May 14, 2017 - Sunday

### TIL

Moving along in Wes's course. I completed module 4 today. So I learned about flash messages, how to query the database for the information we have, and how to edit that information after it's been created.

### What did I like?

Honestly, I really liked everything. Pug is starting to grow on me more. I'm easily starting to see some of its efficiencies.

### What didn't I like?

I still struggle with Wes's pace as well as the fact that the entire front end is made for us. I guess I should stop mentioning that one, but it does bother me a bit... a lot. ðŸ˜€
