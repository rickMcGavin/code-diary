# Week of 5.14.17 - 5.20.17

## May 14, 2017 - Sunday

### TIL

Moving along in Wes's course. I completed module 4 today. So I learned about flash messages, how to query the database for the information we have, and how to edit that information after it's been created.

### What did I like?

Honestly, I really liked everything. Pug is starting to grow on me more. I'm easily starting to see some of its efficiencies.

### What didn't I like?

I still struggle with Wes's pace as well as the fact that the entire front end is made for us. I guess I should stop mentioning that one, but it does bother me a bit... a lot. ðŸ˜€
