# Week of 5.8.17 - 5.13.17

## May 13, 2017 - Saturday

On one random note, I've decided to only do the first 7 modules of Wes Bos's node course. I have a few reasons for doing this: 

- I do want to stay focused on the front end, and I want to grab a front end masters subscription and dig in to what they have to offer. Especially some of the more Advanced Vanilla JS courses, etc. 
- I chose module 7 as a natural ending point because that is as far as Wes's simple package version of the course will take you. I bought the master package, but for now I will stop at module 7. This should both satisfy curiousity with node and backend and allow me to get back to focusing on front end development.

### TIL

As I'm going through Wes's node course in regards to Module #3 Database Storage. I learned how to create a store model, which is the schema. This way info in the database is essentially standardized. Random info won't necessarily be inserted that was unexpected.

The other section he teaches is in regards to building the UI with Pug using a mixin.

I also learned about middleware, which was actually really cool.

I learned how to use Async/Await and how to store data to a database!

### What did I like?

So far, I do like that I'm moving in to building the actual app. I really enjoyed learning the concept of Middleware. Wes had a diagram that explained it, and I got to play around with it a little bit making my own silly middleware functions.

I loved using Async/Await. That's exactly what JavaScript needed in my opinion. Callbacks had a tendency to drive me nuts sometimes. I often wondered why couldn't I just do something like tell JavaScript to wait until one thing was finished before starting another specific command. Well, apparently it's here with Async/Await, and it's amazing.

### What didn't I like?

I'm not a huge fan of Jade/Pug. I never care much for writing HTML in a templating language like Pug or HAML. That's just me though. I may one day learn to enjoy it. I'm not there yet though.

Again, I am not a fan of how much Wes has already done for us. I get that it's to focus on the backend, but honestly, I would prefer to build the whole damn thing from the ground up. I like that Wes wants a really nicely designed app at the end of the course, but I almost prefer when someone like Stephen Grider just throws bootstrap on it instead, but still walks you through all of it. At least I don't get the feeling that maybe I'm missing out something.

So far I'm working through the core concepts video section. I did the video on using Pug templates. It's really interesting. I like writing pug, but it's basically the same as writing emmet that you never need to press ctrl + e to convert to HTML.

### What did I like?

Middleware is super interesting. I like how you can control the data before giving a response to the user. ðŸ¤”

### What didn't I like? 

Wes seems to have a habit of setting a project up, and maybe not fully explaining it in my opinion. There's just so much done already. I can see myself reviewing this a lot.

## May 11, 2017 - Thursday

Going to be working on Wes Bos's Node course. Since I got the offer, I may as well work on something I think I'll find fun and I've been dying to do for some time now anyway.

### TIL

I'm giving yarn a shot during this course. I like the feature that it should install packages quicker than npm, so I'm going for it. Plus between React and yarn now, I'm basically a Facebook developer fanboy. Eww.

So upon taking more of Wes's course, I learned how to set up mongoDB on mLab. I downloaded compass to view my database. I hit the routing core concept video where you learn what request and response and the common methods used for each, and how to play around with them a little bit.

### What did I like?

Getting acclimated with request and response was definitely cool and interesting. I have had a desire to learn more about back end for some time, and I'm happy to take some time to do this course before starting my job.

### What didn't I like?

There is an awful lot of code already set up for you when you start this course. He may circle back and show more, but it concerns me because that can't always be the case? Right?

## May 10, 2017 - Wednesday

I took today off too. And why? Because I got the job offer from the company I'd been dying to work for. Why not take the day off?


## May 9, 2017 - Tuesday

### TIL

I learned a little bit about using Semantic UI in react. I havent used Semantic UI at all, so it's interesting to see it first hand in React.

### What did I like?

I like trying to work on my own project that's completely separate from any challenges being given from freeCodeCamp or anything. I like exploring Semantic UI React.

### What didn't I like?

I did not like the huge pain in the ass that is the Marvel API.

## May 8, 2017 - Monday

Unfortunately it was a skipped day. I ran out of time. I did go for a 3 hour on-site interview for a coding job, so even though I'm not officially counting it. Unofficially, it feels like it should. ðŸ˜Ž
