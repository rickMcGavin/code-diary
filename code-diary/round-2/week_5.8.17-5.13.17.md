# Week of 5.8.17 - 5.13.17

## May 11, 2017 - Thursday

Going to be working on Wes Bos's Node course. Since I got the offer, I may as well work on something I think I'll find fun and I've been dying to do for some time now anyway.

### TIL

I'm giving yarn a shot during this course. I like the feature that it should install packages quicker than npm, so I'm going for it. Plus between React and yarn now, I'm basically a Facebook developer fanboy. Eww.

So upon taking more of Wes's course, I learned how to set up mongoDB on mLab. I downloaded compass to view my database. I hit the routing core concept video where you learn what request and response and the common methods used for each, and how to play around with them a little bit.

### What did I like?

Getting acclimated with request and response was definitely cool and interesting. I have had a desire to learn more about back end for some time, and I'm happy to take some time to do this course before starting my job.

### What didn't I like?

There is an awful lot of code already set up for you when you start this course. He may circle back and show more, but it concerns me because that can't always be the case? Right?

## May 10, 2017 - Wednesday

I took today off too. And why? Because I got the job offer from the company I'd been dying to work for. Why not take the day off?


## May 9, 2017 - Tuesday

### TIL

I learned a little bit about using Semantic UI in react. I havent used Semantic UI at all, so it's interesting to see it first hand in React.

### What did I like?

I like trying to work on my own project that's completely separate from any challenges being given from freeCodeCamp or anything. I like exploring Semantic UI React.

### What didn't I like?

I did not like the huge pain in the ass that is the Marvel API.

## May 8, 2017 - Monday

Unfortunately it was a skipped day. I ran out of time. I did go for a 3 hour on-site interview for a coding job, so even though I'm not officially counting it. Unofficially, it feels like it should. ðŸ˜Ž
