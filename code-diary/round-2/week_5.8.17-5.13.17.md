# Week of 5.8.17 - 5.13.17

## May 8, 2017 - Monday

Unfortunately it was a skipped day. I ran out of time. I did go for a 3 hour on-site interview for a coding job, so even though I'm not officially counting it. Unofficially, it feels like it should. ðŸ˜Ž

### TIL

I learned a little bit about using Semantic UI in react. I havent used Semantic UI at all, so it's interesting to see it first hand in React.

### What did I like?

I like trying to work on my own project that's completely separate from any challenges being given from freeCodeCamp or anything. I like exploring Semantic UI React.

### What didn't I like?

I did not like the huge pain in the ass that is the Marvel API.
