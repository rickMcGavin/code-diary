# Goals for Round 2 of 100 Days of Code

It seems appropriate to take a few moments to reflect on my previous round of the 100 days of code challenge, and attempt to improve upon the past performance.

### Goals

1. Better and more endured focus.
  - I did not maintain full focus throughout my entire 100 days. I was going very strong through the first ~80 days, but I definitely started to lose track towards the end. In reality, I think I finished sooner than I recorded. The problem being, I got sloppy with recording my results in the log and tweeting them.
2. More project based. 
  - The challenge was always intended to be focused on building projects. I need to find a way to make that a reality this time around. I often took courses etc. that I counted since I was learning. Almost the last half the 100 days were courses though. I also experienced the issue with courses where you do them, and get a bit of a false sense of confidence _thinking_ you know something really well, but in reality you kind of just typed some stuff that you saw some other people type. I need to struggle a little bit. _If I ever need some project ideas, I am signed up for the 30 sites in 30 days emails that I never started, and I can build those._
3. Slow Down
  - I need to consider slowing down. I think I'm trying to go so fast that it's actually slowing me down overall if that makes sense. 
4. No off days
  - Seriously, I want to go 100 days straight. That may be a little tough since I have a move coming up, but with some careful planning, I can probably make it happen. If not, I can plan the time off. I let in too many unexpected days off last round.
